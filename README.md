ImmuneCrypt
===========

A file manager apps for iOS device. This app is build on proposed immune-inspired approaches in designing a new function for cryptographic algorithm named as 3D-AES

Feature
=======
- create files/add files or picture from photo gallery
- linking with cloud based app ?
- files/message encryption/decryption
- input -> encrypt -> output


To-Do List
=========
- create library based on cryptography algorithm Z3D-AES
- design UI for the app, a file manager.
- re-think the features of the app.
